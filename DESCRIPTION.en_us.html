    Bytesized is a pixel font made solely to be (decently) readable at a ridiculously small scale - 3 by 4 pixels modulo diacritics!
    A few compromises are made here and there, including only supporting the core Latin character set,
    and some "creative" designs for certain glyphs, but the font is overall quite legible.
    The name is in reference to the fact that, if you restrict the font to only the ASCII character set,
    each glyph is only 12 bits, meaning it can be stored in only 144 bytes, or 192 with padding!
    In order to get pixel-perfect font rendering, you'll want to use a font size of 8 pixels, or any multiple thereof.
